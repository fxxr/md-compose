**md-include** is a lightweight Node.js utility that lets you include Markdown files inside other Markdown files using a simple `[[[path/to/file.md]]]` syntax.  
Perfect for building modular documentation, reusable templates, and large Markdown projects.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ§© Include one Markdown file into another
- âš¡ Works recursively â€” assemble complex documents easily
- ðŸ§± Keeps your docs modular and maintainable
- ðŸª¶ Simple, dependency-free, and lightweight

## Installation

```bash
npm install md-include
```

## Usage

Use the special [[[ path/to/file.md ]]] syntax inside a Markdown document to include another Markdown file.

#### header.md

```markdown
# Common Header for All Pages
```

#### footer.md

... and the second one in `footer.md`.

```markdown
Follow me on [Github](https://github.com/fxxr)
```

#### page.md

It's where those two fragments are included.

```markdown
[[[ header.md ]]]

...Page content...

[[[ footer.md ]]]
```

#### Code example

```javascript
// Async version
import processIncludes from 'md-include'
const result = await processIncludes('page.md')
console.log(result)

// Sync version
import {processIncludesSync} from 'md-include'
const resultSync = await processIncludesSync('page.md')
console.log(resultSync)
```

Output:

```markdown
# Common Header for All Pages

...Page content...

## Use cases

- Combine multiple Markdown files into a single document
- Reuse common sections like headers, footers, or legal disclaimers
- Simplify large documentation or static site projects
- Automate assembling Markdown files before publishing

## Limitations

- Only Markdown files with `.md` extension are supported
- Only local relative paths are allowed 
- Paths are resolved relative to the current Markdown file
- Parent directory references (`..`) are disallowed for safety
